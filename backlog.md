### Gamedesign
+ Explore design revolving around transportation as objective. The animation "2017-04-29.Baustelle@commit[9582471].gif" illustrates how already implemented core mechanic enables transportation: Adding and removing components in the construction is sufficient to move an object around.

### Gameplay
+ Introduce goal and compute scenario completion/solution condition.
+ Enable scoring comparison between different possible solutions: cost for components.
+ Undo function: Go back in time befor last addition of construction component.
+ Recycle function: Remove component and return a portion of what has been spent on that component.
+ Mechanics: Beam mass proportional to length and force on joint dependend on beam mass.

### UI
+ Drag gesture: Affordance for dragging when user clicks on joint.
+ Forward communication of game over condition in advance: Indicate importance of height detoriation to player (Â¿smiley face expression on flag?).

### Atmosphere
+ Sound effects for beam failure.
+ Sound effects for beam stress or movement.
